Name: Darren Ting
I spent 44 hours on this problem (3 hours on #1, 7 hours on #2, 16 hours on #3, 6 hours on #4, 7 hours on #5, 3 hours on the bonus problem, 2 hours writing up the report in Latex)
I sought help from Prof. Hughes and various TAs.
Various TAs helped me with conceptual issues, understanding certain errors and whether or not certain movies are good or bad. 
Thank you so much for being so helpful this year!
